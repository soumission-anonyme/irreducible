# Are Probabilistic Robust Accuracy Bounded

This repository contains the code accompanying the paper **"Are Probabilistic Robust Accuracy Bounded"**. The experiments and analyses are included in two Jupyter notebooks.

## Notebooks

- [`Compute upper bound.ipynb`](Compute upper bound.ipynb): Contains code and experiments related to practically derive the Bayes error of probabilistic robust accuracy.
- [`Training for probabilistic robustness.ipynb`](Training for probabilistic robustness.ipynb): Includes code for probabilistically robust training.
